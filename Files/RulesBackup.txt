First of all, follow the Discord Terms of Service and Guidelines.
ー https://discord.com/terms and https://discord.com/guidelines

**[Rules P1]** [These rules apply to all catgirl media channels unless otherwise stated]
1 ➤ **Catgirls and Foxgirls only.** No other races are allowed. 
ー Including but not limited to *normal animals or furries.*
ー Also *traps* are banned, hence **Cat/Fox "girls" only**.

2 ➤ Use appropriate channels!
ー If you find that your picture can go into another channel that you do not have message permissions in, you should wait, or a mod will move it under their own behalf. 
ー Unsure where to upload? Use #:question:image-help.

3 ➤ Torture/Harsh rape/Slavery is not allowed.
ー If this is the stuff you like, you shouldn't be here. This server is for adorable/hot pictures, not pictures of catgirls in danger or dying.

4 ➤ No beastiality. 
ー This includes catgirls getting done by animals. It is illegal in most countries/states as well.
ー Whether you agree or not, catgirls are not animals. They are humans with cat appendages.

5 ➤ No lolicons or shotacons in the NSFW section.
ー This is self-explanatory, yall.

6 ➤ No futanari in ANY channel.
ー It's literally girls with dicks. These are only allowed in ||#:warning:cursed||.
